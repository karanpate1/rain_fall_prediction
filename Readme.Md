# RainFall_Prediction

->step_1 = understand the dataset by describe(),shape,info() type methods

->step_2 = replaced T with 0.0 and - with 0.0 and removed the unnecessary files

->step_3 = train the linear regression model and visualize the data with various plots

->step_4 = trained the xg_boost model and compare the result with linear regression model results

with this analysis i found that the DewPoint and the Humidity id directly in corelation with the amount of rain and the windspeed and visibility is not affecting much
